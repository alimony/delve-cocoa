Delve can post its findings to a server automatically. To use this feature,
open Preferences, enter a server address, and click Test. If any
authentication is needed for the given server, you will be asked for
credentials which will then be saved in the system keychain. If the server
passes the test (i.e. the little light turns green and says “Server OK”) all
paths Delve finds will be posted there in real-time.

Paths will be posted to the server using POST requests, containing one field
called “path”. To properly handle incoming data from Delve, your server should
listen for such requests and fetch the path field.
