          Delve automatically searches the internet for computers that
 share any drives via Apple File Sharing (AFP) or Windows File Sharing (SMB).

This application is a showcase of the unsecure terms under which people handle
  their private data. As you will notice you can sometimes access someoneâ€™s
entire harddrive directly over the internet. This is most often not intended.
